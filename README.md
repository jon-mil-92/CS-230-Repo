# CS-230 Software Design Document Overview

> Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
Out client is The Gaming Room. They needed Creative Technology Solutions to propose solutions on how to translate their Android game application Draw It or Lose It into a web-based application using the client-server application architecture. This would allow their application to run on various operating platforms in a web browser environment. Our client needed us to design the underlying program structure of Draw It or Lose It, explain the integration of Draw It or Lose It into a distributed environment, and recommend an operating platform, along with the necessary architectures, in which to host the back-end of Draw It or Lose It.
