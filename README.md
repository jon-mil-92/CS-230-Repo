# CS 230 Software Design Document Overview

> Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

&ensp; Our client is The Gaming Room. They needed Creative Technology Solutions to propose solutions on how to translate their Android game application Draw It or Lose It into a web-based application using the client-server application architecture. This would allow their application to run on various operating platforms in a web browser environment. Our client needed us to design the underlying program structure of Draw It or Lose It, explain the integration of Draw It or Lose It into a distributed environment, and recommend an operating platform, along with the necessary architectures, in which to host the back-end of Draw It or Lose It.

> What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

&ensp; We believe the documentation was presented clearly and concisely. This included a detailed explanation of the application's Domain Model, the evaluations of each potential operating platform for the client and server sides of the application, as well as a strategic recommendation for the operating platform in which to host the application.

> What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

&ensp; Working through the design document allowed for a clear understanding of how to procede with the implementation for the structure of the web version of Draw It or Lose It. It allowed for the program to be structured in a way that catered towards the clien-server architecture.

> If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

&ensp; After further consideration, the evaluation for the client side of the application for the various operating platforms could have been explained in more detail. This would include further evaluation of the various web browsers that are supported for each operating platform.

> How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

&ensp; The user's needs were carefully considered in the design of the web version of Draw It or Lose It. The user experience was considered for the design of the software. This included a platform recommendation leading to the most accessible and useable version of Draw It or Lose It. The needs of the user guides the design process of software. The goal is to make the software accommodate for every need of the user in terms of the scope of the application.

> How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

&ensp; The needs of both the client and the user were considered during the design process of Draw It or Lose It. The needs of the client were first considered, and then the needs of the user further guided the rest of the design process. For future software designs, it is important to choose the correct operating platforms and architectures to meet all of the needs of the client and provide the best user experience. The target operating platform will change the way the software is developed, and it will need to be considered early in the development process.
